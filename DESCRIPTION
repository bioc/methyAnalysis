Description: The methyAnalysis package aims for the DNA methylation data  
     analysis and visualization. A new class is defined to keep the 
     chromosome location information together with the data. The current
     version of the package mainly focus on analyzing the Illumina Infinium 
     methylation array data, but most methods can be generalized to other 
     methylation array or sequencing data.
